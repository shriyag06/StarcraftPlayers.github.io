								<h2>Dataset</h2>
								
							</header>
							<p>The dataset comprises 3,995 rows and 20 columns, which will serve as the basis for 
							making predictions using various attributes.</p>

								<h3>1) Data Inconsistency </h3>
					
							</header>
						
						</div>
							<p>In the dataset, certain columns contained inconsistent data, 
							including symbols like '?'. To address this issue, we initially replaced 
							these symbols with 'NaN' values and subsequently filled these missing values with the
							median, especially since these variables 
							exhibited a right-skewed distribution.</p>

								<h3>2) Data Transformation </h3>
					
							</header>
							<p>To rectify the right-skewed nature of the data, appropriate transformations like 
							taking the cube root, square root, 
							applying logarithm, and utilizing the Box-Cox method were implemented.The illustration
							displays the degree of skewness within one of the characteristics.Skewed data is problematic in data analytics as 
							it can lead to biased predictions, violate statistical assumptions, 
							complicate model performance, distort descriptive statistics, 
							and hinder decision-making, ultimately undermining the 
							reliability and accuracy of insights derived from the data. 
							Addressing skewness through suitable transformations or using 
							robust modeling approaches is crucial to mitigate these issues.</p>

								<h3>3) Feature Selection </h3>
					
							</header>
							
							
							
						</div>
						<p>Two techniques were employed for feature selection: 
							L1 Regularization and Information Gain. These approaches assisted in
							pinpointing the top 10 essential features for forecasting player ranks.
							After feature selection, standardization was applied to ensure uniform 
							scaling across variables, preventing potential biases stemming from
							differing measurement units.</p>

								<h3>4) Handling Imbalanced Class </h3>
					
							</header>
							<p>To address the imbalance in the target class, which corresponds 
							to various player ranks, oversampling methods were utilized to create 
							extra instances of the minority classes. This strategy proved to be more
							efficient than both SMOTE and undersampling approaches.The League index, 
							serving as the target variable, consists of eight unique classes, with the 
							count of instances in each class visible.</p>
